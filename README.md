#String-using-all-methods

Team 1 Creating String Data Structure Using all Methods
Objective
The project aims to develop a detailed and versatile implementation of a string data structure in Python, featuring all common and essential string manipulation methods. It will help users understand the internal workings of string operations and provide a foundation for more complex text-based applications.

🎉 String Operations GUI with Tkinter
Welcome to the String Playground! 🎢 A Python GUI where your strings come to life! With a sleek Tkinter interface, you can play around with strings like a magician—reverse them, check if they’re palindromes, split them into pieces, and much more. 🚀

✨ Features
🪄 String Transformation

Turn lowercase to UPPERCASE and vice versa.
Reverse the string like magic! 🌀
🔍 String Exploration

Check if it’s a palindrome (Hint: Was it a car or a cat I saw?).
Find hidden substrings like a detective. 🕵️
🛠️ String Modification

Replace words or remove spaces.
Split strings into chunks or glue them back together.
Outcome
Created an interactive GUI application using Python's Tkinter library for performing various string operations.

The application includes the following key features:
String Manipulations:
Convert strings to uppercase and lowercase. Reverse a string. Check if the string is a palindrome.

Substring Operations:
Find substrings and their positions. Replace substrings with user-defined replacements.

Advanced Operations:
Split a string using a custom delimiter. Join multiple strings with a user-defined joiner.
